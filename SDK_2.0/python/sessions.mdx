## Introduction

A <code>session</code> is a collection of events that are related to long-term user interactions. A session can be started, resumed, and ended at any time and may contain many traces; similarly, traces can have many LLM requests.

For the use case of a chatbot, a session may be the entire conversation. For an agent, a session may encompass a single task execution. The scope of the session is specific to your application and what is most useful for you.

Baserun uses a <code>session</code> identifier to group traces and LLM requests together into a session.

<Accordion title="OpenAI(session: Optional[str], **kwargs): OpenAI" defaultOpen="true">
  <ParamField path="session" type="string">
    An identifier for the current session. For example, you might user a session ID from your application framework or authenticiation library.
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

To create a session, simply pass the session when creating the client, or set the property post-instantiation.

```python
client = OpenAI(session="session123")
# Alternatively
client.session = "session123"
```
