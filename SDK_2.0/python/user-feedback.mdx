User feedback is an excellent source for assessing the quality of an LLM application. In Baserun, feedback is collected either as a 0-1 score or custom defined metadata. The feedback is then displayed in the input/output tab inside the trace detail or request detail panel.

<ParamField path="score" type="numeric">
  The score is a number between 0 and 1. It is used to rate the quality of the
  LLM response.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="metadata" type="JSON-serializable">
  Extra information about the feedback. For example, a user comment.
</ParamField>
```python
    client.feedback(1, metadata = {("comment", user_comment)})
```
