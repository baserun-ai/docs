### Adding tags to a completed trace or completion
After a trace has been completed you may wish to add additional tags to a trace or completion. For example, you might have user feedback that is gathered well after the fact. To add these tags, you need to store the <code>trace_id</code>, and, if the tag is for a completion, the completion_id. You can then use the <code>tag</code>, <code>log</code>, or <code>feedback</code> functions to submit those tags.

```python
from baserun import OpenAI, log, feedback

client = OpenAI(name="trace to be resumed")
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    name="completion to be resumed",
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are three activities to do in Paris?"}],
)

# Store these values
trace_id = client.trace_id
completion_id = completion.completion_id

# A few moments later...
log("Tagging resumed", trace_id=trace_id, completion_id=completion_id)
feedback("User satisfaction", 0.9, trace_id=trace_id, completion_id=completion_id)

```
