## Why Compare? 
When crafting writing prompts, small changes in wording or configuration can lead to major differences in results. Managing and sharing different versions of these prompts, especially among team members, can be challenging. The Baserun Compare feature enables the entire team to compare prompt templates, models, and configurations side by side, facilitating easier iteration and performance evaluation.

## How does Compare work in Baserun?
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Click the "Compare" button located in the top right corner of the prompt details in your playground.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the prompt or prompt versions you would like to compare.">
    By default, Baserun pre-selects the previous version. Remove the second prompt row if you want to perform bulk testing through uploading your own csv with the current prompt.

    Alternatively, you can use the parameterize settings, where you can enter a range of parameters and generate different versions accordingly.
