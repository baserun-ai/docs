title: Compare Prompts
description: Compare prompt templates, models, model parameters.

When crafting writing prompts, small changes in wording or configuration can lead to major differences in results. Managing and sharing different versions of these prompts, especially among team members, can be challenging. The Baserun Compare feature enables the entire team to compare prompt templates, models, and configurations side by side, facilitating easier iteration and performance evaluation.

## Use cases

* **Deciding which models or configurations:** Helps pick the best option by comparing their results side by side.
* **Decide which prompt version performs better:** Helps figure out which way of asking works best by comparing different prompt versions.
* **Regression Tests/Backtesting:** Helps check if new results match what's expected, to spot any regressions or deviations.
* **Iterative Improvement of Prompts:** Helps understand the impact of prompt variations, enabling iterative improvements for enhanced clarity and accuracy.


## Features

* Supports version control for prompt templates, models, and model parameters.
* Enables comparison of prompts generated by the entire team.
* Facilitates sharing of reports with the team.
* Provides side-by-side comparisons for easy analysis.

* Allows for easy export of data and results.

## Instruction
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Click the "Compare" button located in the top right corner of the prompt details in your playground.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the prompt or prompt versions you would like to compare.">
    By default, Baserun pre-selects the previous version. Remove the second prompt row if you want to perform bulk testing through uploading your own csv with the current prompt.
