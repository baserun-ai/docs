## Sessions

A Session is a collection of LLM calls that are related to a long-term user interaction. A session can be started, resumed, and ended at any time and may contain many traces.

User Sessions are used to group traces together in the [Users](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/users) and [Sessions](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/user-sessions) monitoring pages.

For the Use cases of a chat bot, a Session may be the entire conversation. For an agent, a Session may encompass a single task execution. The scope of the session is specific to your application and what is most useful for you.

### Adding Sessions

If you're building a system where user interactions happen in a sequence—like a chat bot—you'll find it useful to group these interactions into a single session. The (`with_session`) context manager in Baserun allows you to do just that. By providing a username or User ID, you can create a new session. By providing a session ID you can continue an existing session. This allows you to group all related traces under either the User or Session, making it easier to debug or analyze the user's journey through your application.

### Create a new session

<CodeGroup>
```python python
import baserun
   
with baserun.with_session(identifier=username_or_id) as session:
    # Store session ID to be continued later
    session_id = session.id
    run_chatbot()
```

```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun'
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const openai = new OpenAI()

async function main() {
  await baserun.init()
  const { data, sessionId } = await baserun.session({
    async session() {
      // add business logic including traces in here
      return openai.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: `Say "this is a test"`,
          },
        ],
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      })
    },
    user: 'user@example.com',
  })

  console.log({ data, sessionId })
}

main()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Continuing an existing session

Using the Session ID that was collected when the session was started you can then resume that session by providing the session ID to the `with_session` context manager.

### Full example

<CodeGroup>
```python python
from uuid import uuid4
from openai import OpenAI

import baserun

PROMPT = """As a customer service representative for an online pet product retailer, your main goal is to
provide a positive and informative chat experience for customers..."""

@baserun.trace
def run_chatbot():
    """An extremely basic chatbot that is executed inside of a single Baserun user session"""
    client = OpenAI()
    conversation = [{"role": "system", "content": PROMPT}]
    conversation_id = str(uuid4())

    print(f"Start your conversation. Type `exit` to end the conversation.\n> ", end="")
    user_input = input()
    conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})

    while user_input != "exit":
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
            messages=conversation,
        )
        content = completion.choices[0].message.content
        conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": content})

        print(f"{content}\n> ", end="")
        user_input = input()
        conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    baserun.api_key = YOUR_BASERUN_API_KEY_HERE
    openai.api_key = YOUR_OPEANI_API_KEY_HERE
    baserun.init()

    with baserun.with_session(identifier="user@example.com"):
        run_chatbot()

````


```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun'
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const openai = new OpenAI()

async function main() {
  await baserun.init()
  const { data, sessionId } = await baserun.session({
    async session() {
      return openai.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: `Say "this is a test"`,
          },
        ],
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      })
    },
    sessionId: 'e2792182-c0cc-4a7b-86cb-93d990a74dae' // pass in existing session id
    user: 'exampel@user.com',
  })

  console.log({ data, sessionId })
}

main()
````

</CodeGroup>

Providing a username or ID (the value is up to you) will allow you to group traces in the [Users](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/users) and [Sessions](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/user-sessions) monitoring pages.
