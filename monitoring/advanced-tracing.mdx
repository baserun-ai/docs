This page goes over some advanced tracing features.

## Adding a trace name

If you're tracing multiple functions, you can use the `start_trace` context manager to distinguish between them:

<CodeGroup>
```python python
  def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
  with baserun.start_trace(name="General knowledge question"): # Your code here
```
  
```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun'

const workflow = baserun.trace(async () => {
  // some llm calls or other logic here

  return 'my result'
}, 'trace name')

async function main() {
  await baserun.init()
  await workflow()
}

````

</CodeGroup>
<Frame>
![Trace name](/images/monitor-trace-name.png)
</Frame>

Within a `start_trace` context any calls to OpenAI or Anthropic will automatically be included in the trace.

## Setting a trace's result

By default a trace's `result` value will be the return value of the function that is traced. If you want to be more explicit, you can set the `result` value of a trace.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace() as trace:
        # Your code here

        trace.result = my_result

````
```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun'

const workflow = baserun.trace(async () => {
  // some llm calls or other logic here

  return 'my result'
}, 'trace name')

async function main() {
  await baserun.init()
  await workflow()
}

````

</CodeGroup>
<Frame>

</Frame>

## Adding custom metadata

You can also add custom metadata. This metadata could be whatever you like, provided that it is JSON serializable. For instance, you may want to include references to other objects or systems.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace() as trace:
        # Your code here

        # Add whatever metadata you like
        trace.metadata = {
          "answer_id": answer_id
        }

````
```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun'

const workflow = baserun.trace(async () => {
  // some llm calls or other logic here

  return 'my result'
}, {
  name: 'trace name',
  metadata: {
    requestId: '1234'
  }
})

async function main() {
  await baserun.init()
  await workflow()
}
````
</CodeGroup>
