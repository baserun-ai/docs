This page goes over some advanced tracing features.

## Adding a trace name

If you're tracing multiple functions, you can use the `start_trace` context manager to distinguish between them:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace(name="General knowledge question"): # Your code here
```

```typescript typescript
const askQuestion = baserun.trace(
  async (question = 'What is the capital of the US?') => {
    // Your code here
  },
  'General knowledge question' // Trace name
)
```

</CodeGroup>
<Frame>

</Frame>

Within a `start_trace` context any calls to OpenAI or Anthropic will automatically be included in the trace.

## Setting a trace's result

By default a trace's `result` value will be the return value of the function or context that is traced. If you want to be more explicit, you can set the `result` value of a trace.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace() as trace:
        # Your code here, for example:
        answer_id = answer_question(question)

        trace.result = my_result
````

```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun'

const workflow = baserun.trace(async () => {
  // some llm calls or other logic here

  return 'my result'
}, 'trace name')
```

</CodeGroup>
<Frame>

</Frame>

## Adding custom metadata

You can also add custom metadata. This metadata could be whatever you like, provided that it is JSON serializable. For instance, you may want to include references to other objects or systems.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace(name="Answer question") as trace:
        # Make a completion
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}],
        )

        # Your code here, for example:
        answer_id = persist_answer(question, completion)

        # Add whatever metadata you like
        trace.metadata = {
          "answer_id": answer_id
        }

```

```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun'

const workflow = baserun.trace(
  async () => {
    
    const openai = new OpenAI();

    const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [
        { role: "user", content: "What are is the capital of the US?" },
      ],
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    });

    return chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content
  },
  {
    name: 'Answer question',
    metadata: {
      requestId: '1234',
    },
  }
)

```

</CodeGroup>

## Associating with an LLM request

By default, annotations such as logs and checks are associated with a trace as a whole. To associate a with particular LLM request, you simply need to pass the completion ID from your LLM request. To do so using OpenAI's SDK, you can do the following:

<CodeGroup>
```python python
@baserun.trace
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}],
    )
    # Your code here, for example:
    answer = persist_answer(question, completion)

    # Create the annotation
    annotation = baserun.annotate(completion.id)

    # Capture whatever annotations you need
    annotation.check("answer.answer_id", type(answer.id), 
    annotation.log("Answer", metadata={"answer_id": answer.id})

    # Make sure to submit the annotation
    annotation.submit()
````

</CodeGroup>

Here is how the user feedback will look like in Baserun dashboard:
