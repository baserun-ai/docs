# Sessions

A Session is a collection of LLM calls that are related to a long-term user interaction. A session can be started, resumed, and ended at any time and may contain many traces.

User Sessions are used to group traces together in the [Users](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/users) and [Sessions](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/user-sessions) monitoring pages.

For the use case of a chat bot, a Session may be the entire conversation. For an agent, a Session may encompass a single task execution. The scope of the session is specific to your application and what is most useful for you.

## Adding Sessions

If you're building a system where user interactions happen in a sequence—like a chat bot—you'll find it useful to group these interactions into a single session. The (`with_session`) context manager in Baserun allows you to do just that. By providing a username or User ID, you can create a new session. By providing a session ID you can continue an existing session. This allows you to group all related traces under either the User or Session, making it easier to debug or analyze the user's journey through your application.

### Create a new session

<CodeGroup>
```python python
import baserun
   
with baserun.with_session(identifier=username_or_id) as session:
    # Store session ID to be continued later
    session_id = session.id
    run_chatbot()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

### Continuing an existing session

Using the Session ID that was collected when the session was started you can then resume that session by providing the session ID to the `with_session` context manager.

<CodeGroup>
```python python
import baserun
   
with baserun.with_session(session_id=session_id) as session:
    run_chatbot()
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Providing a username or ID (the value is up to you) will allow you to group traces in the [Users](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/users) and [Sessions](https://baserun.ai/monitoring/user-sessions) monitoring pages.
