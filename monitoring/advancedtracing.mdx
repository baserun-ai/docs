This page goes over some advanced tracing features.

## Adding a Trace Name

If you're tracing multiple functions, you can use the `start_trace` context manager to distinguish between them:

<CodeGroup>
```python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace(name="General knowledge question"):
        # Your code here
```
</CodeGroup>

Within a `start_trace` context any calls to OpenAI or Anthropic will automatically be included in the trace.

## Setting a trace's result

By default a trace's `result` value will be the return value of the function that is traced. If you want to be more explicit, you can set the `result` value of a trace.

<CodeGroup>
```python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace() as run:
        # Your code here

        run.result = my_result
```
</CodeGroup>

## Adding custom metadata

You can add custom metadata to a trace as well. This metadata could be whatever you like, as long as it's JSON serializable. For instance, you may want to include references to other objects or systems.

<CodeGroup>
```python
def ask_question(question="What is the capital of the US?") -> str:
    with baserun.start_trace() as run:
        # Your code here

        # Add whatever metadata you like
        run.metadata = {
          "answer_id": answer_id
        }
```
</CodeGroup>
