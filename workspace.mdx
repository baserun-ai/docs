A workspace enables you and your team to collaborate on projects. While each organization typically has one primary workspace, it can create multiple workspaces. A user can be a member of several workspaces across different organizations. Each workspace can include many members, facilitating collaboration within and across organizations.

## Create an organization

When you sign up, a modal will prompt you to create an organization. After creating an organization, you can invite other team members.

## Invite collaboraters

Navigate to the top left corner, click on the 'Organization' tab, then select 'Manage Organization' > 'Invite Members'. Enter the user emails to send invitations.
