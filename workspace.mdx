All the prompt templates, datasets, test runs, logs, and traces in Baserun are organized by workspace.

A workspace allows you and your team to collaborate on a project. Each organization has one workspace. One user can belong to many workspaces. An organization can have multiple workspaces, and each workspace has different members.

## Create an organization

When you sign up, you will see a modal asking you to create an organization. Once an organization is created, you can invite other team members.

## Invite collaboraters

Navigate to the Top left corner, click on the Organization tab, click Manage organization > Memebers> Invitations, then enter the user emails.
