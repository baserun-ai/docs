## Use case:

Get insight into individual LLM requests, including prompt templates, input, output, duration, token usage cost, and duration.

## Features:

- Support Python and Typescript
- Automatically logs OpenAI and Anthropic LLM calls
- Provide generative token usage and context token usage
- Provide estimated cost
- Support evaluation
- Provide duration
- Supports async functions
- Support collecting user feedback (Coming soon)

## Introduction:

When the Baserun SDK is initialized explicitly or via our testing plugins, all OpenAI and Anthropic chat and completion requests are automatically logged with no additional code changes. We capture LLM prompts, configuration, and usage. We do this by injecting a very thin wrapper around the client libraries.

For an in-depth overview of how our logging data is structured, please see our Logging Overview page.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Baserun SDK">

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash python
    pip install baserun
    ```

    ```bash typescript
    npm install baserun
    # or
    yarn add baserun
    ```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Generate an API key">

Create an account at [https://baserun.ai](https://baserun.ai). Then generate an API key for your project in the [settings](https://baserun.ai/settings) tab. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export BASERUN_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Or if using python, set `baserun.api_key` to its value:

```python
baserun.api_key = "br-..."
```

</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Baserun">

At your applicationâ€™s startup:

<CodeGroup>
```python python
import baserun

if env == 'production':
baserun.init()

````

```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun';

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    baserun.init();
}
````

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
