title: Compare prompt versions
---

When crafting writing prompts, small changes in wording or configuration can lead to major differences in results. Managing and sharing different versions of these prompts, especially among team members, can be challenging. The Baserun Compare feature enables the entire team to compare prompt templates, models, and configurations side by side, facilitating easier iteration and performance evaluation.

  <Step
    title="Click the `Compare` button at top right corner of the prompt
    details in your playground."
  >
    In the latest version, we merged the "Compare" and "Playground" tabs into
    one. You can now switch between the two modes through tabs. "New session"
    will default to the "Playground" mode."New compare session" will default to
    the "Compare" mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the prompt and the versions you would like to compare.">
    By default, Baserun pre-selects the previous version, but you can also
    create a new version within the comparison report.
