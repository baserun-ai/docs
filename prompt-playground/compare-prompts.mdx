title: Compare prompts
---

When crafting writing prompts, small changes in wording or configuration can lead to major differences in results. Managing and sharing different versions of these prompts, especially among team members, can be challenging. The Baserun Compare feature enables the entire team to compare prompt templates, models, and configurations side by side, facilitating easier iteration and performance evaluation.

### Instruction

<Steps>
  <Step
    title="Click the `Compare` button at top right corner of the prompt
    details in your playground."
  ></Step>
  <Step title="Select the prompt and the versions you would like to compare.">
    By default, Baserun pre-selects the previous version. Remove the second
    prompt row if you wish to perform bulk testing with a single prompt.

    Alternatively, you can use the parameterized settings, where you can enter a
    range of parameters to generate different variations accordingly.
