## Custom Models

The Baserun prompt playground supports custom models. Any model whose API is OpenAI-compatible can be added. This includes models from HuggingFace, OpenPipe, and others.

## Walkthrough

To add a custom model, go to the Setttings page in the Baserun UI.

Then, click the "Add custom model" button.

<Frame>![Add custom model](/images/custom-model-add-model.png)</Frame>

You will be prompted to enter a label for the model (this is up to you), the model's name (must match the provider's model name), API key, and API base. This example shows an OpenPipe fine-tuned model.

Once you've added the model, you can use it in the playground.
