</Step>
<Step title="Enter the session name">
Then, you will be redirected to the edit view.

The left side is the editor panel, where you can edit the prompts. On the right side is the test panel, where you can create multiple test cases to test the prompt. Baserun will automatically save all session versions and tests. You can access past versions through the "Version History" button on the top right and restore any previous versions.

<Step title="Select the model you want to use">
Baserun support OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, and Gemini by default.You can also add custom models by clicking the "Add custom model" button.
</Step>
<Step title="Optional to insert dynamic input variables into your prompt template using curly brackets {{ and }}.">
You will use these variables to track LLM requests inputs, conduct evaluations, and compile datasets for future fine-tuning.
</Step>
<Step title="Start testing">
Type a user and press 'Enter' or click the 'Run' button to submit.
</Step>
<Step title="Rerun a thread">
You can edit a previous message in a thread. Clicking 'Rerun' will create a new thread, allowing you to preserve the history of your previous conversation.

</Steps>

## Version management

Baserun automatically creates a new version of the session as you edit the prompt template and run tests. A new version is created when you click "Run Tests."

You can view a previous version by clicking on a past version inside the version history panel; all past versions are read-only. To restore an earlier version, hover over the version name, open the dropdown menu, and click the "Restore" button. This action will duplicate the past version and add it to the top.
