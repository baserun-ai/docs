title: 'vitest integration'

When using typescript and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/), the only thing you need to add is `beforeAll` in your test file.

## Setup

```bash
npm install baserun
# or
yarn add baserun
```

```typescript test_module.spec.ts
import { baserun } from 'baserun'
import { describe, beforeAll } from 'vitest'

describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // the only thing needed to make baserun work
    await baserun.init()
  })

  // ... the tests
})
```

```bash
npm run vitest test_module.spec.ts
```

## Running multiple tests

It's often helpful to exercise the same test over multiple examples. To do this, we suggest doing a simple for loop to autogenerate your tests and for larger numbers of examples you can read from a file or other data structure.

```typescript typescript
import { baserun } from 'baserun';

const examples = [
	{ place: 'Paris', expected: 'Eiffel Tower' },
	{ place: 'Rome', expected: 'Colosseum' },
];

describe('Baserun end-to-end', () => {
	beforeAll(async () => {
		// add this
		await baserun.init();
	});

	for (const { place, expected } of examples) {
		it(`should suggest the ${expected}`, async () => {
			await baserun.trace(async () => {
      // Use baserun.trace here if your test involves multiple LLM calls or if you want to include any custom logs
				const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
					model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
					temperature: 0.7,
					messages: [
						{
							role: 'user',
							content: `What are three activities to do in ${place}?`,
						},
					],
				});

				expect(chatCompletion.choices[0].message!.content!).toContain(expected);
				return chatCompletion;
			})();
		});
	}
});
```

## Naming

Baserun lets you compare test results and debug each step side by side. We consider the full path of the describe and it names of the jest test as a unique identifier for the test. In the example above, two tests would be run and identified by `("Baserun end-to-end", "should suggest the Eiffel Tower")` and `("Baserun end-to-end", "should suggest the Colosseum")`
