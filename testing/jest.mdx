When using typescript and [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs) you can simply install the `baserun` preset and start testing immediately.

The preset works by automatically collecting and aggregating all LLM and baserun logs during the course of a test and then uploading them to baserun to review and collaborate on with your team.

## Setup

```bash
npm install baserun
# or
yarn add baserun

jest --preset baserun test_module.spec.ts
...
========================Baserun========================
Test results available at: https://baserun.ai/runs/<id>
=======================================================
```

## Existing presets

If you are already using a jest preset such as ts-jest you will need to merge the presets in your jest config.

```js
// jest.config.js or jest.config.baserun.js

const tsPreset = require("ts-jest/jest-preset");
const baserunPreset = require("baserun/jest-preset");

module.exports = {
  ...tsPreset,
  ...baserunPreset,
  testTimeout: 10000,
};
```

Then to run a test

```bash
jest test_modules.spec.ts
...
========================Baserun========================
Test results available at: https://baserun.ai/runs/<id>
=======================================================
```

## Running multiple tests

It's often helpful to exercise the same test over multiple examples. To do this, we suggest doing a simple for loop to autogenerate your tests and for larger numbers of examples you can read from a file or other data structure.

```python

const examples = [{place: "Paris", expected: "Eiffel Tower"}, {place: "Rome", expected: "Colosseum"}];

describe('Baserun end-to-end', () => {
    for (const {place, expected} of examples) {
        it(`should suggest the ${expected}`, async () => {
            const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
              model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
              temperature: 0.7,
              messages: [
                {
                  role: 'user',
                  content: `What are three activities to do in ${place}?`,
                },
              ],
            });

            expect(chatCompletion.choices[0].message!.content!).toContain(expected);
        });
    }
});
```

## Naming

Baserun lets you compare test results and debug each step side by side. We consider the full path of the describe and it names of the jest test as a unique identifier for the test. In the example above, two tests would be run and identified by `("Baserun end-to-end", "should suggest the Eiffel Tower")` and `("Baserun end-to-end", "should suggest the Colosseum")`
