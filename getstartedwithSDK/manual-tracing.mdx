### Introduction

At the moment, the Baserun Python SDK 2.0 supports all models using OpenAI library and Anthropic library, regardless of the underlying model's provider. We are continuously adding support for new models. If you have a specific model you would like to use, please reach out to us at [hello@baserun.ai](mailto:hello@baserun.ai) or [join our community](https://discord.gg/EtR7NFQ4).

If you use another provider or library, you can still use Baserun by manually creating "generic" objects. Notably, generic completions must be submitted explicitly using `submit_to_baserun()`. Here's what that looks like:

### Example

```python
from baserun.wrappers.generic import (
    GenericChoice,
    GenericClient,
    GenericCompletion,
    GenericCompletionMessage,
    GenericInputMessage,
)

question = "What is the capital of the US?"
response = call_my_custom_model(question)

client = GenericClient(name="My Traced Client")
completion = GenericCompletion(
    model="my custom model",
    name="My Completion",
    input_messages=[GenericInputMessage(content=question, role="user")],
    choices=[GenericChoice(message=GenericCompletionMessage(content=response))],
    client=client,
    trace_id=client.trace_id,
)
completion.submit_to_baserun()
```
